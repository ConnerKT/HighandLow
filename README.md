This is a game you can play to try to guess a random number determined.

This code functions with print statements, if statements, and a for loop.

The game gives you 7 tries to guess a number from 1-100, if you input the correct number the game prints out the number of tries it took to achieve it.

This project I tested using imported functions, using random and time to make my code more unique.

I also put all of my code into its own function so the code could be reusable if needed.
